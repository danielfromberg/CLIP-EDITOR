Download this patch, have Max installed (trial is okay, so is lapsed trial), and make sure you place the abstractions 'colorSwap.maxpat' and 'chance-bang.maxpat' wherever Max looks in your computer's file directory for patches. 

There will be more writing here soon. Happy clipping. 

To Do List/current problems:
- Reformat the record module to take textures instead of matricies (this patch currently sends out matricies).
- Fix the math errors in my from ___ to ___ number windows. 
- I think the manual loop toggle is totally broken. I haven't been using it and I just realized I haven't looked at that in forever. Whoops!
- Increase modularity of design.
